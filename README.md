# uORFs
This repository contains most of the data and all the scripts used during my final grade project (Apr-Jun 2020)

## Contents
- DATA:
Contains all the data generated by the uORFs_identifier and the process of adding more features to each uORF. The complete files are found in all\_scores

- FGP_RESULTS:
Contains the custom track that can be uploaded to UCSC genome browser, and the code needed to create it and also the files with the scored uORFs using the 5 methods proposed.

- REFERENCE_DATA:
Contains the reference data used for completing the uORFs files with all the additional information. (there is a lot of data missing here, due to its big size, see [Data Availability](#Data-Availability)

- SCRIPTS:
Contains the scripts for identifying all the uORFs in a given genome ([uORFs_identifier](#uORFs_identifier)) and also for adding all the additional features.

- replicate\_yale\_analysis:
Contains all the analysis pipeline writen by [McGillivray et al. (2018)](https://github.com/gersteinlab/uORFs). We have used their scripts and adapted them with our methods and data to obtain a proper classification. R scripts and data are found inside.

- time:
Contains a file that records the time taken by each execution of the uORFs_identifier.pl file.



### Data Availability

GENCODE annotation files available at:
www.gencodegenes.org

All conservations scores source files can be downloaded from these sites:
- phastCons: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/phastCons100way/hg38.phastCons100way.bw
- phyloP: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/phyloP100way/hg38.phyloP100way.bw
- phyloCSF: https://data.broadinstitute.org/compbio1/PhyloCSFtracks/hg38_100/20170118/ all PhyloCSF*.bw files

All ribosed data we used was from GWIPS table browser (https://gwips.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start)


All these data should be downloaded and placed in the proper directories.




### uORFs_identifier

The uORFs identifier tool can be runned using a command like this:

`perl uORFs_identifier.pl -i ../../DATA/input_data/input_file.txt -of ../../DATA/raw_data/raw_uORFs/output_file.tsv -m number_of_processes -sp species 2> error`


In our study:

`perl uORFs_identifier.pl -i ../../DATA/input_data/all_human_EnsemblGeneIDs_v34.txt -of ../../DATA/raw_data/raw_uORFs/allENSG_15-5-2020_at_17-12.tsv -m 100 -sp Human 2> error`


#### Requirements

Ensembl Core API installed
see http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html for the installation procedure.
GitTools installation recommended in order to manage version updates easily.


#### Dependencies

For the execution, there are some additional dependencies of Perl modules. The following lines allow you to download the corresponding libraries in a Linux system, but there are other ways to install these dependencies.

sudo apt-get install -y libparallel-forkmanager-perl
sudo apt-get install -y libdbd-mysql-perl
